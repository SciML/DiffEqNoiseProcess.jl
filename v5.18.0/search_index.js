Here we will show how to directly construct a NoiseProcess which generates Gaussian white noise.\n\nThis is the noise process, that uses randn!. A special dispatch is added for complex numbers for (randn()+im*randn())/sqrt(2). This function is DiffEqNoiseProcess.wiener_randn (or with ! respectively).\n\nThe first function that must be defined is the noise distribution. This is how to generate W(t+dt) given that we know W(x) for xt₀t. For Gaussian white noise, we know that\n\nW(dt)  N(0dt)\n\nfor W(0)=0 which defines the stepping distribution. Thus, its noise distribution function is:\n\n@inline function WHITE_NOISE_DIST(W, dt, rng)\n    if typeof(W.dW) <: AbstractArray && !(typeof(W.dW) <: SArray)\n        return @fastmath sqrt(abs(dt)) * wiener_randn(rng, W.dW)\n    else\n        return @fastmath sqrt(abs(dt)) * wiener_randn(rng, typeof(W.dW))\n    end\nend\n\nfor the out of place versions, and for the inplace versions\n\nfunction INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_DIST(rand_vec, W, dt, rng)\n    wiener_randn!(rng, rand_vec)\n    sqrtabsdt = @fastmath sqrt(abs(dt))\n    @. rand_vec *= sqrtabsdt\nend\n\nOptionally, we can provide a bridging distribution. This is the distribution of W(qh) for q01 given that we know W(0)=0 and W(h)=Wₕ. For Brownian motion, this is known as the Brownian Bridge, and is well known to have the distribution:\n\nW(qh)  N(qWₕ(1-q)qh)\n\nThus, we have the out-of-place and in-place versions as:\n\nfunction WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE(W, W0, Wh, q, h, rng)\n    if typeof(W.dW) <: AbstractArray\n        return @fastmath sqrt((1 - q) * q * abs(h)) * wiener_randn(rng, W.dW) + q * Wh\n    else\n        return @fastmath sqrt((1 - q) * q * abs(h)) * wiener_randn(rng, typeof(W.dW)) +\n                         q * Wh\n    end\nend\nfunction INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE(rand_vec, W, W0, Wh, q, h, rng)\n    wiener_randn!(rng, rand_vec)\n    #rand_vec .= sqrt((1.-q).*q.*abs(h)).*rand_vec.+q.*Wh\n    sqrtcoeff = @fastmath sqrt((1 - q) * q * abs(h))\n    @. rand_vec = sqrtcoeff * rand_vec + q * Wh\nend\n\nThese functions are then placed in a noise process:\n\nNoiseProcess(t0, W0, Z0, WHITE_NOISE_DIST, WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE; kwargs)\nNoiseProcess(t0, W0, Z0, INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_DIST, INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE; kwargs)\n\nNotice that we can optionally provide an alternative adaptive algorithm for the timestepping rejections. RSWM() defaults to the Rejection Sampling with Memory 3 algorithm (RSwM3).\n\nNote that the standard constructors are simply:\n\nfunction WienerProcess(t0, W0, Z0 = nothing)\n    NoiseProcess(t0, W0, Z0, WHITE_NOISE_DIST, WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE; kwargs)\nend\nfunction WienerProcess!(t0, W0, Z0 = nothing)\n    NoiseProcess(t0, W0, Z0, INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_DIST, INPLACE_WHITE_NOISE_BRIDGE; kwargs)\nend\n\nThese will generate a Wiener process, which can be stepped with step!(W,dt), and interpolated as W(t).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"abstract_noise_processes/#Alternative-AbstractNoiseProcess-Types","page":"Abstract Noise Processes","title":"Alternative AbstractNoiseProcess Types","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"abstract_noise_processes/","page":"Abstract Noise Processes","title":"Abstract Noise Processes","text":"In addition to the mathematically-defined noise processes above, there exists more generic functionality for building noise processes from other noise processes, from arbitrary functions, from arrays, and from approximations of stochastic differential equations.","category":"page"},{"location":"abstract_noise_processes/","page":"Abstract Noise Processes","title":"Abstract Noise Processes","text":"NoiseWrapper\nNoiseFunction\nNoiseTransport\nNoiseGrid\nNoiseApproximation\nVirtualBrownianTree\nSimpleNoiseProcess\nBoxWedgeTail\npCN","category":"page"},{"location":"abstract_noise_processes/#DiffEqNoiseProcess.NoiseWrapper","page":"Abstract Noise Processes","title":"DiffEqNoiseProcess.NoiseWrapper","text":"NoiseWrapper{T, N, Tt, T2, T3, T4, ZType, inplace} <:\nAbstractNoiseProcess{T, N, Vector{T2}, inplace}\n\nThis produces a new noise process from an old one, which will use its interpolation to generate the noise.

When the in-place version is used without a dispatch for the out-of-place version, the noise_prototype needs to be set.\n\nNoiseTransport Example\n\nThe NoiseTransport requires you to pass an initial time, a transport function, and a random variable. The random variable can be either out-of-place or in-place. It is assumed it is out-of-place when the realization is a subtype of Number, and in-place, when it is a subtype of AbstractArray. Here, a random variable is any function that accepts a random number generator, in the out-of-place case (e.g. rand(rng)), or a random number generator and a realization to be mutated (e.g. rand!(rng, rv)).\n\nAn optional realization rv may be given. The realization rv is used in the first time an AbstractRODEProblem is solved. Subsequent runs of the same problem will draw a different realization from the random variable RV, unless reseed is set to false. In the case of a NoiseProblem, however, a new realization will happen at the first run already, and, in this case, rv can be regarded as a realization prototype, which is necessary in the case of a random vector.\n\nAs a first example, let us implement the Gaussian noise W(t) = sin(Yt), where Y is a normal random variable.\n\nf(u, p, t, rv) = sin(rv * t)\nt0 = 0.0\nW = NoiseTransport(t0, f, randn)\n\nIf we want to build a scalar random process out of a random vector, then an in-place version of the random vector is required, as follows. We can also use parameters in the transport function, in which case the noise_prototype must be given.\n\nusing Random: randn!\nf(u, p, t, rv) = sin(p[1] * t + rv[1]) + cos(p[2] * t + rv[2])\nt0 = 0.0\nrv = randn(2)\np = (π, 2π)\nW = NoiseTransport(t0, f, randn!, rv, noise_prototype = f(nothing, p, t0, rv))\n\nIf the random process is expected to be mulitidimensional, it is preferable to use an in-place transport function, and, in this case, the noise_prototype must be given. Here is an example with a scalar random vector with a beta distribution, from Distributions.jl.\n\nf!(out, u, p, t, rv) = (out .= sin.(rv * t))\nt0 = 0.0\nRV(rng) = rand(rng, Beta(2, 3))\nrv = 0.0\nW = NoiseTransport(t0, f!, RV, rv, noise_prototype = zeros(4))\n\nWe can also have a random vector with a mulitidimensional process, in which case an in-place version of RV is required. For example.\n\nusing Random: randn!\n\nfunction f!(out, u, p, t, v)\n    out[1] = sin(v[1] * t)\n    out[2] = sin(t + v[2])\n    out[3] = cos(t) * v[1] + sin(t) * v[2]\n    nothing\nend\n\nt0 = 0.0\nRV!(rng, v) = (v[1] = randn(rng); v[2] = rand(rng))\nrv = zeros(2)\n\nW = NoiseTransport(t0, f!, RV!, rv, noise_prototype = zeros(3))\n\nA NoiseTransport can be used as driving noise for SDEs and RODEs.

For example, you can generate your desired noise process as an array W with timepoints t, and use the constructor:\n\nNoiseGrid(t, W, Z = nothing; reset = true)\n\nto build the associated noise process. This process comes with a linear interpolation of the given points, and thus the grid does not have to match the grid of integration. Thus, this can be used for adaptive solutions as well. However, one must take note that the fidelity of the noise process is linked to how fine the noise grid is determined: if the noise grid is sparse on points compared to the integration, then its distributional properties may be slightly perturbed by the linear interpolation. Thus, it's suggested that the grid size at least approximates the number of time steps in the integration to ensure accuracy.\n\nFor a one-dimensional process, W should be an AbstractVector of Numbers. For mulitidimensional processes, W should be an AbstractVector of the noise_prototype.\n\nNoiseGrid\n\nIn this example, we will show you how to define your own version of Brownian motion using an array of pre-calculated points. In normal usage, you should use WienerProcess instead, since this will have distributionally-exact interpolations while the noise grid uses linear interpolations, but this is a nice example of the workflow.\n\nTo define a NoiseGrid you need to have a set of time points and a set of values for the process. Let's define a Brownian motion on (0.0,1.0) with a dt=0.001. To do this,\n\ndt = 0.001\nt = 0:dt:1\nbrownian_values = cumsum([0; [sqrt(dt) * randn() for i in 1:(length(t) - 1)]])\n\nNow we build the NoiseGrid using these values:\n\nW = NoiseGrid(t, brownian_values)\n\nWe can then pass W as the noise argument of an SDEProblem to use it in an SDE.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"abstract_noise_processes/#DiffEqNoiseProcess.NoiseApproximation","page":"Abstract Noise Processes","title":"DiffEqNoiseProcess.NoiseApproximation","text":"In many cases, one would like to define a noise process directly by a stochastic differential equation which does not have an analytical solution. Of course, this will not be distributionally-exact and how well the properties match depends on how well the differential equation is integrated, but in many cases , this can be used as a good approximation when other methods are much more difficult.\n\nA NoiseApproximation is defined by a DEIntegrator. The constructor for a NoiseApproximation is:\n\nNoiseApproximation(source1::DEIntegrator,\n    source2::Union{DEIntegrator, Nothing} = nothing;\n    reset = true)\n\nThe DEIntegrator should have a final time point of integration far enough away, such that it will not halt during the integration. For ease of use, you can use a final time point as Inf. Note that the time points do not have to match the time points of the future integration, since the interpolant of the SDE solution will be used. Thus, the limiting factor is error tolerance, and not hitting specific points.\n\nNoiseApproximation Example\n\nIn this example, we will show how to use the NoiseApproximation to build our own Geometric Brownian Motion from its stochastic differential equation definition. In normal usage, you should use the GeometricBrownianMotionProcess instead since that is more efficient and distributionally-exact.\n\nFirst, let's define the SDEProblem.
